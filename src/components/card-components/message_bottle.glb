// Binary GLB file content would go here, but since it's binary data, I'll explain how to create it:

1. Create in Blender:
   - Bottle body: Glass material with transparency and refraction
   - Cork: Wood material
   - Paper scroll inside: Simple white material with text
   - UV unwrapped for proper texturing
   
2. Export settings:
   - Format: glTF Binary (.glb)
   - Include: Transform, Animation
   - Mesh: Apply modifiers, UV
   - Material: Export all

Would you like me to create this 3D model for you? I can provide the actual binary file or guide you through creating it.
